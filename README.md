# ACCSoftwareBootcamp.com

Example code for a work project I did: accsoftwarebootcamp.com.
This project was built using:
- Node 
- Nodemailer to send emails with user contact information
- Express to handle routing 
- Google Analytics
- The front end was built entirely in React
- Sass/SCSS to style every page
- Deployed through Heroku
